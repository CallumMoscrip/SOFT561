# SOFT561
This is the submission folder for SOFT561 buggy coursework. This was an exercise in software development for robotics over distributed systems, in this example an arduino Mega 2560 handle the drive and sensors of the buggy (the sketch is in the Arduino Folder) and a raspberry Pi hosted the ROS nodes and also used the two python scripts to display the ip address on an LCD screen.
The final platform was an Android based app which allowed control of the buggy.
